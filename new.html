          <span>Dear Plkiee</span>
          <br>
          <br>On this special Rose Day, I want you to know that you are the most beautiful part of my life. Just like a rose, you bring color, fragrance, and joy to my world. Every petal reminds me of your kindness. <br>

          <br>The red roses reflect my deep hate😁 for you, and the white ones symbolize the purity of our bond. In this journey of life, you are the most precious bloom in my garden. Your presence makes everything brighter, warmer, and more meaningful.<br>
          
          <br>Thank you for filling my life with love, laughter, and endless happiness.<br>
          
          Happy Rose Day, Sona! 🌹❤️
